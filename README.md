# Randomized Algorithms
## Exercise 1 Selection Aglorithms

1. Implement the lazy select algorithm (given in the lecture). You are also welcom to refer to the following [slides](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/711S09/lec04.pdf).
2. Implement the [Quickselect algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect).
3. Quickselect's worst case performance is O(n^2). The median of medians algorithm improves on Quickselect and has a better worst-case performance (O(n)). Implement the median of [medians algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_of_medians).
4. Benchmark the three algorithms. Write one paragraph to describe your findings.
